# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and optimization changes made to the Quiz-Rework codebase. The primary goals were to eliminate redundant directories, consolidate duplicate code, and identify database schema issues.

## 1. Redundant Directory Removal

The following empty/redundant directories were removed:

- `backend/upload/` - This directory was empty and no longer needed since the application has moved to vector database storage.
- `backend/backend/` - This empty directory was redundant and served no purpose.
- `backend/ai_processing/` - This module was unused as the functionality had been moved to other modules.
- `node_modules/` (root) - Redundant node modules at the root level.
- `backend/node_modules/` - Backend doesn't need Node.js as it's a Django application.

## 2. Text Extraction Code Consolidation

Multiple implementations of PDF text extraction were consolidated to use a single centralized utility:

### Updated Files:

1. **documents/services.py**
   - Modified `DocumentProcessingService.extract_text_from_pdf()` to use the centralized utility

2. **quiz/views.py**
   - Updated `QuizQuestionGenerateFromExistingFileView` to use the centralized text extraction utility

3. **documents/supabase_utils.py**
   - Updated `SupabaseDocumentHandler` to use the centralized text extraction utility

## 3. Package Management Optimization

- Consolidated dependencies from backend/package.json into the root package.json
- Removed redundant backend/package.json and package-lock.json
- Configured root package.json with proper workspaces and scripts
- Kept frontend/package.json intact as it contains specific React dependencies
- Regenerated root package-lock.json to match the consolidated package.json
- Maintained frontend's separate package-lock.json for its specific dependencies
- Optimized frontend package.json by removing duplicate dependencies that are already in the root package.json
- Added new npm scripts for easier dependency management:
  - `install:all`: Installs dependencies for both root and frontend
  - `audit:fix`: Runs audit fix for both root and frontend

## 4. Database Schema Analysis

A detailed analysis of database tables was conducted, identifying:

- Duplicate quiz tables (`quiz` vs `quizzes`)
- Duplicate quiz attempt tables (`quiz_quizattempt` vs `quizzes_quizattempt`)
- Recommendations for consolidation are in the DATABASE_DUPLICATION_REPORT.md file

## 5. Configuration Updates

1. **settings.py**:
   - Removed `ai_processing` from `INSTALLED_APPS`

2. **urls.py**:
   - Removed the URL pattern for `ai_processing`

## 6. Documentation Updates

1. **README.md**:
   - Added information about recent updates and optimizations
   - Updated project structure information
   - Simplified setup instructions

2. **DATABASE_DUPLICATION_REPORT.md**:
   - Documented database table duplication issues
   - Provided recommendations for database cleanup

## Next Steps

1. Consider further consolidation of frontend and root package.json files
2. Implement the database schema recommendations from DATABASE_DUPLICATION_REPORT.md
3. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality remains intact after cleanup
4. Address npm audit warnings and vulnerabilities in package dependencies:
   - The remaining vulnerabilities are in development dependencies (react-scripts)
   - Consider upgrading react-scripts in a separate, controlled update
